        Hey there, I'm Ali, a student from Turkey with a passion for coding
        back-end projects. I love the challenge of solving complex problems
        through programming, and I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my
        skills and expand my knowledge. In addition to coding, I enjoy playing
        basketball and exploring the world of trading. I find that both
        activities require a mix of strategy, focus, and discipline, which are
        all qualities that I strive to bring to my work as a developer. If
        you're looking for a collaborator or just want to chat about
        programming, feel free to reach out to me on

          >Github</a
        >. I'm always open to new opportunities and excited to connect with
        others who share my passion for technology. Thanks for taking the time
        to learn a bit more about me, and I look forward to hearing from you
        soon!
